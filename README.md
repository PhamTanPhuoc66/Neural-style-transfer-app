## ÔøΩ About

A simple Neural Style Transfer application for fun! This project combines the content of one image with the artistic style of another using deep learning. Built with PyTorch and Gradio for an easy-to-use web interface.

### Features

- Web-based interface with Gradio
- Real-time style transfer
- Adjustable parameters (style weight, content weight, epochs, learning rate)
- GPU support for faster processing
- Multiple initialization options

---

## ÔøΩÔ∏è Tech Stack

- **PyTorch** - Deep learning framework
- **VGG19** - Pre-trained model for feature extraction
- **Gradio** - Web interface
- **PIL** - Image processing

---

## üèóÔ∏è Model Architecture

The neural style transfer uses a **VGG19** pre-trained network as feature extractor:

### Content Representation
- **Layer**: `conv4_2` (layer index 21)
- **Purpose**: Captures high-level content structure while preserving spatial information
- **Loss**: MSE between content and generated image features

### Style Representation
- **Layers**: `conv1_1`, `conv2_1`, `conv3_1`, `conv4_1`, `conv5_1` (indices 0, 5, 10, 19, 28)
- **Purpose**: Captures texture and artistic patterns across multiple scales
- **Method**: Gram matrices of feature maps to represent style correlations
- **Loss**: MSE between style and generated image Gram matrices

```python
# Layer configuration
content_layer_n = 21                    # VGG19 conv4_2
style_layers = [0, 5, 10, 19, 28]      # Multiple conv layers for style
```

## üîß Techniques Implemented

This project showcases several deep learning optimization techniques:

- **Adam Optimizer** - Adaptive learning rate optimization
- **Learning Rate Scheduling** - StepLR with decay for stable convergence
- **Gradient Clipping** - Prevents gradient explosion during training
- **Mixed Precision Training** - Memory efficient training with AMP
- **Gram Matrix** - Style representation using normalized feature correlations

```python
# Example: Gradient clipping implementation
torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_([generated_image], max_norm=1.0)

# Learning rate scheduling
scheduler = optim.lr_scheduler.StepLR(optimizer, step_size=100, gamma=0.7)
```
